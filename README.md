Emotion-Based Music Streaming and Curation System
=================================================

This project presents a personalized music recommendation system that adapts to users' facial emotions. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning, the system detects facial expressions in real time and curates music playlists that match the detected mood. The system enhances user engagement by dynamically adjusting playlists based on emotions, providing a more immersive and interactive music experience.

Features
--------
**Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition:**
